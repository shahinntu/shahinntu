### 💡 About Me
Hey there! I'm Shahin, an AI/ML engineer who loves turning complex ideas into reality using the power of machine learning. Currently geeking out over LLMs, computer vision, and multi-modal models. When I'm not coding, you’ll find me gaming or tweaking some AI models just for fun! 😄

### ⚡ What I Do
- 🧠 **LLMs & Large Models** – Working with BERT, GPT, LLaMA, and more to push the boundaries of AI 🤖
- 🎨 **Creative AI** – Generating cool images with Stable Diffusion & GANs 🎨
- 📄 **Document AI** – Building smart tools for document understanding and extraction 📝
- 🛠 **AI Tools** – PyTorch, Huggingface, LangChain… the usual suspects 🔧
